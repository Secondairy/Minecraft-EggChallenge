# Secondairy's Minecraft Speedrun EggChallenge

## Format Information

The format of this challenge is RSG Any%, with an egg permanently placed in your offhand. A run is invalidated if the egg is ever thrown at any point.

This provides a unique challenge in a few different circumstances, such as:

- Using your offhand at all is not possible
- Eating food is slightly more tedious
- Mis-hotkeying can be deadly
- Probably others that I am not considering
