# Secondairy's Minecraft Speedrun EggChallenge

## Format Information

The format of this challenge is RSG Any%, with an egg permanently placed in your offhand. A run is invalidated if the egg is ever thrown at any point.

This provides a unique challenge in a few different circumstances, such as:

- Using your offhand at all is not possible
- Eating food is slightly more tedious
- Drinking potions is near impossible
- Mis-hotkeying can be deadly
- Probably others that I am not considering

## Rules

1. You must be using the official version of the Egg Challenge mod for Minecraft version 1.16.1, found here: https://github.com/Secondairy/Minecraft-EggChallenge/releases/latest

2. You must follow all Speedrun.com Minecraft Speedrunning rules, found here: https://www.speedrun.com/mc?h=Any_Glitchless-Random_Seed-1.16&rules=game

3. You must be using RedLime's Speedrun IGT mod, found here: https://github.com/RedLime/SpeedRunIGT/releases/latest
I'm just one dude - I don't want to time/retime several runs. You can make as many submissions as you want, until submissions close (see Run Submission section). The timing standard used will be IGT. Auto-Retime in Speedrun IGT is allowed.

4. You agree to participate "in the spirit of the challenge", meaning you will not abuse or make use of any exploits or oversights in the mod. This includes rejoining a "dead" world/run. I'll be honest, it's not a well made mode, so I expect some quirks.

5. If you are among the winners, you must have a supported method for receiving the prizes (PayPal, Bank Transfer). Unfortunately because I live in Australia, CashApp/Venmo and similar are not available, so I can't support these.
